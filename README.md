This Task was hosted on Zindi Africa as part of It's weekly challenge. To access it use the link    https://zindi.africa/competitions/zindiweekendz-learning-to-vaccinate-or-not-to-vaccinate   .Work has already begun towards developing a COVID-19 vaccine. From measles to the common flu, vaccines have lowered the risk of illness and death, and have saved countless lives around the world. Unfortunately in some countries, the 'anti-vaxxer' movement has led to lower rates of vaccination and new outbreaks of old diseases.  Although it may be many months before we see COVID-19 vaccines available on a global scale, it is important to monitor public sentiment towards vaccinations now and especially in the future when COVID-19 vaccines are offered to the public. The anti-vaccination sentiment could pose a serious threat to the global efforts to get COVID-19 under control in the long term.  The objective of this challenge is to develop a machine learning model to assess if a Twitter post related to vaccinations is positive, neutral, or negative. This solution could help governments and other public health actors monitor public sentiment towards COVID-19 vaccinations and help improve public health policy, vaccine communication strategies, and vaccination programs across the world.
